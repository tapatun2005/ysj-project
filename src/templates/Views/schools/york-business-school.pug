            p These finding underpinned their research to investigate the attitudes of York Business School students towards ecological justice and awareness of skills required in the transition to green economy. The findings from 3 focus groups show a lack of awareness and understanding of skills needed for transition to green economy among Business School students. 
            p Furthermore, the findings also showed a mixture of attitudes towards ecological justice and lack of understanding of the link between ecological justice and their programme of study. These findings highlight the need of an open discussion among the educators at York Business School about inclusion of ecological justice in curriculum.
